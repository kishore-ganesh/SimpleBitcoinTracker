# SimpleBitcoinTracker
A barebones Bitcoin price tracker with real-time updates and historical data


Built in Javascript, using CanvasJS, jQuery and Bootstrap on the front-end, and Express.js on the backend. 
It is simple, meant for the singular purpose of tracking the price of Bitcoins.

It interfaces with Coindesk's API, and features a "real-time" graph that updates every 30 seconds with the latest information. 

How to use: 

1. npm install
2. node app.js
3. Navigate to localhost:4000
